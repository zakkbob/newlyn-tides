# Newlyn tide predictions

A small website to display tide times generated by my granddad's tide prediction project <br/>
It's hosted if you're interested [tides.zakkbob.dev](https://tides.zakkbob.dev)

Also, yes, the times are hard-coded right now, but I'll work his code into the repo at some point (It's written in python)
